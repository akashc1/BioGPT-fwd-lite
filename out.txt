question: How is de Quervain tendonitis diagnosed and what is the treatment approach? context: answer: target: the answer to the question given the context is that de Quervain tendonitis is often misdiagnosed. The diagnosis is often missed or delayed because of the lack of awareness of the condition and the unavailability of a diagnostic tool. The diagnosis is based on clinical examination, and the use of imaging modalities is not recommended. The treatment of de Quervain tendonitis is nonsurgical, and the most common treatment is corticosteroid injection. The injection is effective in relieving pain and improving function, but the effect is short-lived. Surgical intervention is reserved for patients who do not respond to conservative treatment. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to guide the management of de Quervain tendonitis. More research is needed to determine the most effective diagnostic tool and treatment approach. learned1 learned2 learned3 learned4 learned5 learned6 learned7 learned8 learned9 the answer to the question given the context is no.
